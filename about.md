<h1>About me!</h1>

I was an industrial electrician for 10 years, wiring up multiple data centers and 
production plants. Recently completed B.S. in Computer Science from Eastern Oregon University. 
I enjoy researching security vulnerabilities and exploits as well as learning how to develop 
Proof of Concept models and related tools. I also research android internals and software design.
